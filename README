This repository contains course material for 
"Numerical Heat Transfer for Applications" held for PhD course 
in Engineering Science at Marche Polytechnic University - Ancona (Italy). 
Two different numerical approaches are employed in the course: 
Finite Differences and Finite Volumes (FVM). FVM codes relies on OpenFOAM oriented I/O. 
uFVM code is adopted as a starting point for reading OpenFOAM mesh.
Also computational meshes and usefull functions are uploaded.
